We have done the blockchain game named Head & Road. 

This is the PvP Fighter with possibility of unique items collecting. Users fight in the arena using cars. You have to destroy your opponent's car driver head to win.

This is how our interface looks like.

At the beginning of your session you should collect your car from some items like head, car body and wheels.

Than you with your opponent can fight on the some arenas like this.

Or like this.
<p align="center">
  <img src="Fight2.jpg" width="350" title="Second fight.">

At the end of every session we generate the transaction in blockchain Pravda with all the information about this fight: types of cars, users adresses and result of the fight.

You can try to play our game with tutorial.
